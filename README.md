# Caesar's Cipher Project for CRYPTOGRAPHY uni course

In this project, we were given a map that contained three ciphers (bottom right, top center and middle left).
Each text revealed information on how to decipher the next part, and the last cipher revealed a location.

There is no code for this project since we used the course material and online tools (https://www.dcode.fr/hill-cipher) to complete it.
